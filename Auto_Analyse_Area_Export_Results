//This macro is used to measure the area of a selected region. Input images should already be pre-processed to delete the unselected area and leave only the region that you
want to measure the area of. 
//Create a folder that only contains the images that you want to measure the area of.
//Create another folder called "Area" on Desktop to export the Result file into.
//This macro was originally written to analyse the area of the selected cells for the macropinocytosis assay.

numFiles = lengthOf(fileList); //the lengthOf function counts the number of files in the fileList array (which, by extension, is in the source directory).

saveloc = getDirectory("Choose Ouput Directory"); //Choose a folder where the exported images are to be saved in.
//print(numFiles) //This is optional but you can print out the number of files from the original folder as a way of checking if the code is working.
